# FDS_Final: AI text detection

**AI generated text detection: is it really an impossible task?**

With the widespread use of generative AI models, mostly ChatGPT,
and the impact they have in everyday life, as for example plagiarism in academia and the generation of false informations, this question keeps getting more and more importance. In some cases, this task seems to be solvable with good results; articles' abstracts and science-related text seems to be one of these. On the other hand, the task in its integrity seems impossible to solve. 

This repository contains the code and the dataset used to develop a project on this topic; the project has been carried out as final project for the course of Foundamentals of Data Science ("Data Science" Master Degree, Sapeienza University).
